      <p>The laboratory was very simple. The walls and floor were a plain and polished grey. A lone table stood in the middle of room with a few strange tools upon it. The few selves along the wall were mostly empty, but one item caught your eye and <span class='ai'>Alfred</span>&rsquo;s attention.</p>
      <p><span class='ai'>Alfred</span> immediately begin scanning the small egg. Its gears whirred away in the small cage. <span class='ai'>Alfred</span> scanned the object over and over as numbers and data flashed across your screen. <span class='ai'>Alfred</span> seems confused and frustrated by the device. You move closer to examine the small egg. Small purple and gold gems blink on and off inside.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What is the matter <span class='ai'>Alfred</span>?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>After a pause <span class='ai'>Alfred</span>, &ldquo;<span class='you'>Dave</span>, the device is completely contained, yet it isn't losing any momentum. It has been running for thousands of years without an outside power source.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>You eyes widen even more, &ldquo;A perpetual motion machine, but that is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes it is <span class='you'>Dave</span>, but here it is.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>You cradle the device in one hand. &ldquo;<span class='ai'>Alfred</span>, this will change everything. Prep the ship <span class='ai'>Alfred</span>. We are going home.&rdquo;</p><br>
