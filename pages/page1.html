      <p>&ldquo;<span class='you'>Dave</span>, we are approaching Janus-42. We will be there within an hour.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>You sigh a breath of relief. As an explorer you spend a lot of time in space, and after over nine months you have almost reached your destination. You can rest your feet on solid ground again, if the preliminary readings are correct.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Thank you, <span class='ai'>Alfred</span>,&rdquo; you say to your small droid as it docks onto your cybernetic arm with a click.</p>
      <p>The droid&rsquo;s real name is T.I.G.-1999, but you named your droid <input type='text' value='Alfred' id='aiName'>. It feels more personal for your little friend.</p>
      <p>With <span class='ai'>Alfred</span> on your arm you begin the final inspections: space suit, landing pod, food, etc.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Urgent message from Corporate,&rdquo; <span class='ai'>Alfred</span> announced.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Patch it through <span class='ai'>Alfred</span>.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A hologram of the president of Corporate materializes in front of you. &ldquo;Due to a lawsuit and changes taking place with rules and regulations all ships are required to return to Corporate immediately. All current assignments have been canceled until further notice.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>You slump down in a chair. Less than an hour away and you are commanded to return to Corporate. Another nine months in space.</p><br>
