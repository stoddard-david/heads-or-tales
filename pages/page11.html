      <p>A few hours later, your landing pod touches down on the alien planet, kicking up a small cloud of dust. The cabin hisses as it pressurizes and the doors slide open.</p>
      <p>The light glares off your domed helmet as readings of the autmosphere are displayed upon it. There is traces of oxygen in the air, but not enough. It would be like trying to breath at the top of Mount Everest.</p>
      <p>As you step out of the pod, you are greated by a violet sky and soft dirt beneath your feet. It is nice not to feel the vibration of a ship beneath your feet.</p>
      <p>You look towards the ruins of an ancient civilazation a few kilometers away. Towering building crumbling with age.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;<span class='you'>Dave</span>, I am picking up some strange readings from the forest to the west,&rdquo; <span class='ai'>Alfred</span> informs you as the droid zips around the new landscape. &ldquo;Should we investigate?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The strange readings could prove enlightning, but you have been excited to visit the ruins of the alien race when you spotted them while in orbit. What ever your choice you won't have Corporate back home to help. You are on your own.</p>
