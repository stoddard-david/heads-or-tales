      <p>After nine months returning home all you get is a, &ldquo;Welcome back <span class='you'>Dave</span>. We&rsquo;ll contact you as soon as this whole mess is sorted out.&rdquo;
      <p>They then took <span class='ai'>Alfred</span> and handed you a small check for your trouble.</p>
      <p>The months then stretched into years. Activists argued for greater protection of planets. Governments instituted new policies and laws. The whole process was wrapped in so much red tape it was impossible to navigate it all.</p>
      <p>You never did return to space.</p>
      <p>You always wondered what was on planet Janus-42, but you had to come home. You really didn't have choice, did you?</p>
